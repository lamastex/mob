# working-manuscript-privacyTrajectories
This is a private github repository to work (Julian, Raaz and Marina) on privacy-preserving trajectories.

Julian and his couauthors submitted the conference paper `SwappingTrajectories-PSD_updated.pdf` and our plan is to extend this work for submission to a journal.

We will start from `TrajectorySwapping.tex` and turn it into a submission as a journal paper (see TODOs there).
