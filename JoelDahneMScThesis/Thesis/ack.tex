\section*{Acknowledgements}

This work was partly supported by a research grant to Principal Investigator Raazesh Sainudiin titled 
{\em Mobile Phone Data for Society and Privacy for the Individual: From the Conflict to a Synergy in Transport Flows Analysis} 
from Research Center for Cyber Security at Tel Aviv University established by the State of Israel, 
the Prime Ministerâ€™s Office and Tel-Aviv University. 

The computing infrastructure was partly supported by databricks University Alliance and AWS research credits in the cloud and by Combient Mix AB for an onpremise cluster of INTEL NUCs.

The cost for accommodation and travel for a research visit by Joel Dahne and Raazesh Sainudiin was supported entirely by Combient Mix AB and the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University, respectively.
