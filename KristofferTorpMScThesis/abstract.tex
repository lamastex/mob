    We explore large scale mobility patterns in the
    greater Stockholm area by aggregating address based
    Co-Trajectories collected from mobile network data.
    Two time frames are considered: all Thursdays in 2022,
    and the entire month of February 2023. Each date is 
    represented by a Co-Trajectory which collects the totality
    of mobile device movement of that date. The Co-Trajectories 
    are embedded as high dimensional time:location vectors
    which are then compared using two different distance measures,
    the L1-norm and the Weighted Jaccard index, in order to build multiple 
    distance matrices for analysis and clustering.
    Lastly, an approximation of the weighted Jaccard index, called 
    MinHash is implemented using the I$^2$CWS algorithm.
    The infrastructure is built in a distributive manner using Apache Spark running on an on-premise cluster of 10 computers. The data is based on a large collection of real world mobile data from the MIND dataset.
