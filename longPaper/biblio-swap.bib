abstract="Differential Privacy is one of the most prominent frameworks used to deal with disclosure prevention in statistical databases. It provides a formal privacy guarantee, ensuring that sensitive information relative to individuals cannot be easily inferred by disclosing answers to aggregate queries. If two databases are adjacent, i.e. differ only for an individual, then the query should not allow to tell them apart by more than a certain factor. This induces a bound also on the distinguishability of two generic databases, which is determined by their distance on the Hamming graph of the adjacency relation.",

abstract="Mobile devices with global positioning capabilities allow users to retrieve points of interest (POI) in their proximity. To protect user privacy, it is important not to disclose exact user coordinates to un-trusted entities that provide location-based services. Currently, there are two main approaches to protect the location privacy of users: (i) hiding locations inside cloaking regions (CRs) and (ii) encrypting location data using private information retrieval (PIR) protocols. Previous work focused on finding good trade-offs between privacy and performance of user protection techniques, but disregarded the important issue of protecting the POI dataset D. For instance, location cloaking requires large-sized CRs, leading to excessive disclosure of POIs (O(|D|) in the worst case). PIR, on the other hand, reduces this bound to {\$}O({\backslash}sqrt{\{}|D|{\}}){\$}, but at the expense of high processing and communication overhead. We propose hybrid, two-step approaches for private location-based queries which provide protection for both the users and the database. In the first step, user locations are generalized to coarse-grained CRs which provide strong privacy. Next, a PIR protocol is applied with respect to the obtained query CR. To protect against excessive disclosure of POI locations, we devise two cryptographic protocols that privately evaluate whether a point is enclosed inside a rectangular region or a convex polygon. We also introduce algorithms to efficiently support PIR on dynamic POI sub-sets. We provide solutions for both approximate and exact NN queries. In the approximate case, our method discloses O(1) POI, orders of magnitude fewer than CR- or PIR-based techniques. For the exact case, we obtain optimal disclosure of a single POI, although with slightly higher computational overhead. Experimental results show that the hybrid approaches are scalable in practice, and outperform the pure-PIR approach in terms of computational and communication overhead.",

abstract="We present a research roadmap of a Planetary Nervous System (PNS), capable of sensing and mining the digital breadcrumbs of human activities and unveiling the knowledge hidden in the big data for addressing the big questions about social complexity. We envision the PNS as a globally distributed, self-organizing, techno-social system for answering analytical questions about the status of world-wide society, based on three pillars: social sensing, social mining and the idea of trust networks and privacy-aware social mining. We discuss the ingredients of a science and a technology necessary to build the PNS upon the three mentioned pillars, beyond the limitations of their respective state-of-art. Social sensing is aimed at developing better methods for harvesting the big data from the techno-social ecosystem and make them available for mining, learning and analysis at a properly high abstraction level. Social mining is the problem of discovering patterns and models of human behaviour from the sensed data across the various social dimensions by data mining, machine learning and social network analysis. Trusted networks and privacy-aware social mining is aimed at creating a new deal around the questions of privacy and data ownership empowering individual persons with full awareness and control on own personal data, so that users may allow access and use of their data for their own good and the common good. The PNS will provide a goal-oriented knowledge discovery framework, made of technology and people, able to configure itself to the aim of answering questions about the pulse of global society. Given an analytical request, the PNS activates a process composed by a variety of interconnected tasks exploiting the social sensing and mining methods within the transparent ecosystem provided by the trusted network. The PNS we foresee is the key tool for individual and collective awareness for the knowledge society. We need such a tool for everyone to become fully aware of how powerful is the knowledge of our society we can achieve by leveraging our wisdom as a crowd, and how important is that everybody participates both as a consumer and as a producer of the social knowledge, for it to become a trustable, accessible, safe and useful public good.",

discovery and data mining. Thanks to the increasing availability of
transaction data, it is now possible to provide new and improved services
based on users{\textquoteright} and customers{\textquoteright} behavior. However, this puts the citizen{\textquoteright}s
privacy at risk. Thus, it is important to develop new privacy-preserving
data mining techniques that do not alter the analysis results significantly.
In this paper we propose a new approach for anonymizing sequential
data by hiding infrequent, and thus potentially sensible, subsequences.
Our approach guarantees that the disclosed data are k-anonymous and
preserve the quality of extracted patterns. An application to a real-world
moving object database is presented, which shows the effectiveness of our
approach also in complex contexts.},

Since trajectory information contains personal mobility data, it may reveal sensitive details like habits of behavior, religious beliefs, and sexual preferences. Current solutions focus on anonymizing data before its publication. Nevertheless, we argue that this approach gives the user no control about the information she shares. For this reason, we propose a novel approach that works inside users' mobile devices, where users can decide and configure the quantity and accuracy of shared data.",

Nowadays several personal records are kept in computerized databases. Personal data is collected and kept in census databases, medical databases, employee databases, among others. There has always been an asymmetry between the benefits of computerized databases and the rights of individual data subjects. Some data protection principles can be derived from the legal framework. In this survey, we present some basic cryptographic and non-cryptographic techniques that may be used for enhancing privacy, we focus mainly on anonymization in databases and networks, discuss some differences and interactions among the well-known models of k-anonymity and differential privacy and finally present some challenges to privacy that come from big data analytics.",
