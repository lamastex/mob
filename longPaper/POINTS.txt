1. Mix-zones are special cases of Swap-Mob, where the swap-mob-resolution is small enough. 
 - Specifically, a mixed-zone introduces a possibly larger swap-node where the trajectories going in to the swap node get "new ids" as they come out.
   And, this is equivalent to splitting the trajectoies (by removing the edge that comes of out the swap-node)
2. Adaptive-Swapping:
  - Let each swap node i have a swappable fraction $s_i \in [0,1]$. If s_i = 0 for all i then Swap-Mob return the full data and = 1 returns naive swap-mob.
    In an adaptive Swap-Mob we can set the s_i as close to zero as necessary at the appropriate swap-nodes that are in need of (traffic/security) control operations and therefore require the necessary statistics of mobility data (for eg. longer segments of real trajectories in the viscinity of the traffic jammed area) WHILE guaranteeing k-anoymity specified by the adversary's predicate.
3. Swap-Mob preserves the estimator \hat{P} of the transition prob matrix of the continuous time first-order Markov chain of independent RWs - therefoe it is a suffcicient sanitizer for this model. Can also allow O-D matrix constrained sap-mob for ensuring more information is preserved.
4. Differential privacy focused on \hat{P} (see photo).
   - use maximum_i TV distance between i-th row of \hat{P} and \hat{P'} ()where P' is obtaine dy removing an edge/transition in any one individual to identify highly sensitive trajectory segments and iteratively remove them until the TV distance across all rows for any  \hat{P} and \hat{P'} is < 0.01 or some threshold.
   - then add "topological noise" and or or random-surfer-stationary noise with mixture weights \epsilon_T and \epsilon_S and (1-\epsilon_S-\epsilon_T) ...
