Unfortunately, their implementation as key-value stores makes it difficult to achieve ACID transactions and high performance: metadata operations such as listing objects are expensive, and consistency guarantees are limited. In this paper, we present Delta Lake, an open source ACID table storage layer over cloud object stores initially developed at Databricks. Delta Lake uses a transaction log that is compacted into Apache Parquet format to provide ACID properties, time travel, and significantly faster metadata operations for large tabular datasets (e.g., the ability to quickly search billions of table partitions for those relevant to a query). It also leverages this design to provide high-level features such as automatic data layout optimization, upserts, caching, and audit logs. Delta Lake tables can be accessed from Apache Spark, Hive, Presto, Redshift and other systems. Delta Lake is deployed at thousands of Databricks customers that process exabytes of data per day, with the largest instances managing exabyte-scale datasets and billions of objects.}, journal = {Proc.

abstract = {In this paper we define a new compact Hilbert index which, while maintaining all of the advantages of the standard Hilbert curve, permits spaces with unequal dimension cardinalities. The compact Hilbert index can be used in any application that would have previously relied on Hilbert curves but, in the case of unequal side lengths, provides a more memory efficient representation. This advantage is particularly important in distributed applications (Parallel, P2P and Grid), in which not only is memory space saved but communication volume is significantly reduced.}

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01679},
	abstract = {The generalized Stieltjes constants \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}\_n(v)\$ are, up to a simple scaling factor, the Laurent series coefficients of the Hurwitz zeta function \${\textbackslash}zeta(s,v)\$ about its unique pole \$s = 1\$. In this work, we devise an efficient algorithm to compute these constants to arbitrary precision with rigorous error bounds, for the first time achieving this with low complexity with respect to the order{\textasciitilde}\$n\$. Our computations are based on an integral representation with a hyperbolic kernel that decays exponentially fast. The algorithm consists of locating an approximate steepest descent contour and then evaluating the integral numerically in ball arithmetic using the Petras algorithm with a Taylor expansion for bounds near the saddle point. An implementation is provided in the Arb library. We can, for example, compute \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}\_n(1)\$ to 1000 digits in a minute for any \$n\$ up to \$n=10{\textasciicircum}\{100\}\$. We also provide other interesting integral representations for \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}\_n(v)\$, \${\textbackslash}zeta(s)\$, \${\textbackslash}zeta(s,v)\$, some polygamma functions and the Lerch transcendent.},

By combining multi-level execution trees and columnar data layout, it is capable of running aggregation queries over trillion-row tables in seconds. The system scales to thousands of CPUs and petabytes of data, and has thousands of users at Google. In this paper, we describe the architecture and implementation of Dremel, and explain how it complements MapReduce-based computing. We present a novel columnar storage representation for nested records and discuss experiments on few-thousand node instances of the system.},
