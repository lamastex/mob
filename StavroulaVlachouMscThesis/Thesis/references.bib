Unfortunately, their implementation as key-value stores makes it difficult to achieve ACID transactions and high performance: metadata operations such as listing objects are expensive, and consistency guarantees are limited. In this paper, we present Delta Lake, an open source ACID table storage layer over cloud object stores initially developed at Databricks. Delta Lake uses a transaction log that is compacted into Apache Parquet format to provide ACID properties, time travel, and significantly faster metadata operations for large tabular datasets (e.g., the ability to quickly search billions of table partitions for those relevant to a query). It also leverages this design to provide high-level features such as automatic data layout optimization, upserts, caching, and audit logs. Delta Lake tables can be accessed from Apache Spark, Hive, Presto, Redshift and other systems. Delta Lake is deployed at thousands of Databricks customers that process exabytes of data per day, with the largest instances managing exabyte-scale datasets and billions of objects.}, journal = {Proc.

The compact Hilbert index can be used in any application that would have previously relied on Hilbert curves but, in the case of unequal side lengths, provides a more memory efficient representation. This advantage is particularly important in distributed applications (Parallel, P2P and Grid), in which not only is memory space saved but communication volume is significantly reduced.}

	abstract = {The generalized Stieltjes constants \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}\_n(v)\$ are, up to a simple scaling factor, the Laurent series coefficients of the Hurwitz zeta function \${\textbackslash}zeta(s,v)\$ about its unique pole \$s = 1\$. In this work, we devise an efficient algorithm to compute these constants to arbitrary precision with rigorous error bounds, for the first time achieving this with low complexity with respect to the order{\textasciitilde}\$n\$. Our computations are based on an integral representation with a hyperbolic kernel that decays exponentially fast. The algorithm consists of locating an approximate steepest descent contour and then evaluating the integral numerically in ball arithmetic using the Petras algorithm with a Taylor expansion for bounds near the saddle point. An implementation is provided in the Arb library. We can, for example, compute \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}\_n(1)\$ to 1000 digits in a minute for any \$n\$ up to \$n=10{\textasciicircum}\{100\}\$. We also provide other interesting integral representations for \${\textbackslash}gamma{\textbackslash}\_n(v)\$, \${\textbackslash}zeta(s)\$, \${\textbackslash}zeta(s,v)\$, some polygamma functions and the Lerch transcendent.},

	abstract = {At the core of many engineering problems is the solution of sets of equa­ tions and inequalities, and the optimization of cost functions. Unfortunately, except in special cases, such as when a set of equations is linear in its un­ knowns or when a convex cost function has to be minimized under convex constraints, the results obtained by conventional numerical methods are only local and cannot be guaranteed. This means, for example, that the actual global minimum of a cost function may not be reached, or that some global minimizers of this cost function may escape detection. By contrast, interval analysis makes it possible to obtain guaranteed approximations of the set of all the actual solutions of the problem being considered. This, together with the lack of books presenting interval techniques in such a way that they could become part of any engineering numerical tool kit, motivated the writing of this book. The adventure started in 1991 with the preparation by Luc Jaulin of his PhD thesis, under Eric Walter's supervision. It continued with their joint supervision of Olivier Didrit's and Michel Kieffer's PhD theses. More than two years ago, when we presented our book project to Springer, we naively thought that redaction would be a simple matter, given what had already been achieved . . .},

We extend regular pavings to mapped regular pavings which map sub-boxes in a regular paving of x to elements in some set Y. Arithmetic operations defined on Y can be extended point-wise over x and carried out in a computationally efficient manner using Y-mapped regular pavings of x. The efficiency of this arithmetic is due to recursive algorithms on the algebraic structure of finite rooted binary trees that are closed under union operations. Our arithmetic has many applications in function approximation using tree based inclusion algebras and statistical set-processing.},

Two types of spherical surface domains are considered: (1) the interior of a spherical triangle, and (2) the exterior of a great circle arc extending for less thanπ radians (a spherical surface with a slit). In both cases, zero boundary conditions are imposed. In order to solve the resulting second-order elliptic partial differential equations in two independent variables, a finite difference approximation is employed. The fundamental eigenvalue is approximated by iteration utilizing the power method and point successive overrelaxation. Some numerical results are given and compared, in certain special cases, with analytical solutions to the eigenvalue problem. The significance of the numerical eigenvalue results is discussed in terms of the singularities in the solution of three-dimensional boundary-value problems near a polyhedral corner of the domain.},

	abstract = {Many recent papers deal with the enumeration of 2-dimensional walks with prescribed steps confined to the positive quadrant. The classification is now complete for walks with steps in \$\$\{{\textbackslash}backslash\{0, {\textbackslash}backslashpm 1{\textbackslash}backslash\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\}\$\$ \{ 0 , ± 1 \} 2 : the generating function is D-finite if and only if a certain group associated with the step set is finite. We explore in this paper the analogous problem for 3- dimensional walks confined to the positive octant. The first difficulty is their number: we have to examine no less than 11074225 step sets in \$\$\{{\textbackslash}backslash\{0, {\textbackslash}backslashpm 1{\textbackslash}backslash\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\}\$\$ \{ 0 , ± 1 \} 3 (instead of 79 in the quadrant case). We focus on the 35548 that have at most six steps. We apply to them a combined approach, first experimental and then rigorous. On the experimental side, we try to guess differential equations. We also try to determine if the associated group is finite. The largest finite groups that we find have order 48 — the larger ones have order at least 200 and we believe them to be infinite. No differential equation has been detected in those cases. On the rigorous side, we apply three main techniques to prove D-finiteness. The algebraic kernel method, applied earlier to quadrant walks, works in many cases. Certain, more challenging, cases turn out to have a special Hadamard structure which allows us to solve them via a reduction to problems of smaller dimension. Finally, for two special cases, we had to resort to computer algebra proofs. We prove with these techniques all the guessed differential equations. This leaves us with exactly 19 very intriguing step sets for which the group is finite, but the nature of the generating function still unclear.},

We separate models which clearly have a D-finite generating function from models for which there is no reason to expect that their generating function is D-finite, and we isolate a small set of models whose nature remains unclear and requires further investigation. For these, we give some experimental results about their asymptotic behaviour, based on the inspection of a large number of initial terms. At least for some of them, the guessed asymptotic form seems to tip the balance towards non-D-finiteness.},

	abstract = {The classic eigenvalue problem of the Laplace operator inside a variety of polygons is numerically solved by using a method nearly identical to that used by Fox, Henrici, and Moler in their 1967 paper. It is demonstrated that such eigenvalue calculations can be extended to unprecedented precision, often to well over a hundred digits, or even thousands of digits. To work well, geometric symmetry must be exploited. The de-symmetrized fundamental domains (usually triangular) considered here have at most one non-analytic vertex. Dirichlet, Neumann, and periodic-type edge conditions are independently imposed on each symmetry-reduced polygon edge. The method of particular solutions is used whereby an eigenfunction is expanded in an N-term Fourier-Bessel series about the non-analytic vertex and made to match at a set of N points on the boundary. Under the right conditions, the so-called point-matching determinant has roots that approximate eigenvalues. A key observation is that by increasing the number of terms in the expansion, the approximate eigenvalue may be made to alternate above and below, while approaching what is presumed to be the exact eigenvalue. This alternation effectively provides a new method to bound eigenvalues, by inspection. Specific examples include Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues within polygons with re-entrant angles (L-shape, cut-square, 5-point star) and the regular polygons. Thousand-digit results are reported for the lowest Dirichlet eigenvalues of the L-shape, and regular pentagon and hexagon.},

The authors provide an extensive experimental investigation and illustrates the impact of various bounds, types of subdivision, strategies of candidate selection on the performance of algorithms. A comparison of various Lipschitz bounds over simplices and an extension of Lipschitz global optimization with-out the Lipschitz constant to the case of simplicial partitioning is also depicted in this text. Applications benefiting from simplicial partitioning are examined in detail such as nonlinear least squares regression and pile placement optimization in grillage-type foundations. Researchers and engineers will benefit from simplicial partitioning algorithms such as Lipschitz branch and bound, Lipschitz optimization without the Lipschitz constant, heuristic partitioning presented.

Hence, for computational purposes, working directly on these resolutions appears to be much more efficient. However, this approach seems to have been overlooked in the past. In this paper, we describe six different resolutions of the Kingman–Tajima coalescent together with the corresponding Markov chains, which are essential for inference methods. Two of the resolutions are the well-known {\textbackslash}(n{\textbackslash})-coalescent and the lineage death process due to Kingman. Two other resolutions were mentioned by Kingman and Tajima, but never explicitly formalized. Another two resolutions are novel, and complete the picture of a multi-resolution coalescent. For all of them, we provide the forward and backward transition probabilities, the probability of visiting a given state as well as the probability of a given realization of the full Markov chain. We also provide a description of the state-space that highlights the computational gain obtained by working with lower-resolution objects. Finally, we give several examples of summary statistics that depend on a coarser resolution of Kingman’s coalescent, on which simulations are usually based.},

Such methods are known as approximate likelihood or Bayesian computations. Using a controlled lumped Markov chain and computational commutative algebraic methods, we compute the exact likelihood of the SFS and many classical linear combinations of it at a non-recombining locus that is neutrally evolving under the infinitely-many-sites mutation model. Using a partially ordered graph of coalescent experiments around the SFS, we provide a decision-theoretic framework for approximate sufficiency. We also extend a family of classical hypothesis tests of standard neutrality at a non-recombining locus based on the SFS to a more powerful version that conditions on the topological information provided by the SFS.},

	abstract = {The rapid advance in handheld communication devices and the appearance of smartphones has allowed users to connect to the Internet and surf on the WWW while they are moving around the city or traveling. Location based services have been developed to deliver content that is adjusted to the current user location. Social networks have also responded to the challenge of users who can access the Internet from any place in the city, and location based social-networks like Foursquare have become very popular in a short period of time. The popularity of these applications is linked to the significant advantages they offer: users can exploit live location-based information to take dynamic decisions on issues like transportation, identification of places of interest or even on the opportunity to meet a friend or an associate in nearby locations. A side effect of sharing location-based information is that it exposes the user to substantial privacy related threats. Revealing the user's location carelessly can prove to be embarrassing, harmful professionally, or even dangerous. Research in the data management field has put significant effort on anonymization techniques that obfuscate spatial information in order to hide the identity of the user or her exact location. Privacy guaranties and anonymization algorithms become increasingly sophisticated offering better and more efficient protection in data publishing and data exchange. Still, it is not clear yet what are the greatest dangers to user privacy and which are the most realistic privacy breaching scenarios. The aim of the paper is to provide a brief survey of the attack scenarios, the privacy guaranties and the data transformations employed to protect user privacy in real time. The paper focuses mostly on providing an overview of the privacy models that are investigated in literature and less on the algorithms and their scaling capabilities. The models and the attack scenarios are classified and compared, in order to provide an overview of the cases that are covered by existing research.},

	title = {Guaranteed and robust a posteriori bounds for {Laplace} eigenvalues and eigenvectors: a unified framework},
	abstract = {This paper develops a general framework for a posteriori error estimates in numerical approximations of the Laplace eigenvalue problem, applicable to all standard numerical methods. Guaranteed and computable upper and lower bounds on an arbitrary simple eigenvalue are given, as well as on the energy error in the approximation of the associated eigenvector. The bounds are valid under the sole condition that the approximate i-th eigenvalue lies between the exact (i−1)-th and (i+1)-th eigenvalue, where the relative gaps are suﬃciently large. We give a practical way how to check this; the accuracy of the resulting estimates depends on these relative gaps. Our bounds feature no unknown (solution-, regularity-, or polynomial-degree-dependent) constant, are optimally convergent (eﬃcient), and polynomial-degree robust. Under a further explicit, a posteriori, minimal resolution condition, the multiplicative constant in our estimates can be reduced by a ﬁxed factor; moreover, when an elliptic regularity assumption on the corresponding source problem is satisﬁed with known constants, this multiplicative constant can be brought to the optimal value of 1 with mesh reﬁnement. Applications of our framework to nonconforming, discontinuous Galerkin, and mixed ﬁnite element approximations of arbitrary polynomial degree are provided, along with numerical illustrations. Our key ingredient are equivalences between the i-th eigenvalue error, the associated eigenvector energy error, and the dual norm of the residual. We extend them in an appendix to the generic class of bounded-below self-adjoint operators with compact resolvent.},

These services provide new prospects for users: getting directions to work in the morning, leaving a check-in at a restaurant at noon and checking next day's weather in the evening are possible right from any mobile device embedding a GPS chip. In these location-based applications, the user's location is sent to a server, which uses them to provide contextual and personalised answers. However, nothing prevents the latter from gathering, analysing and possibly sharing the collected information, which opens the door to many privacy threats. Indeed, mobility data can reveal sensitive information about users, among which one's home, work place or even religious and political preferences. For this reason, many privacy-preserving mechanisms have been proposed these last years to enhance location privacy while using geolocated services. This article surveys and organises contributions in this area from classical building blocks to the most recent developments of privacy threats and location privacy-preserving mechanisms. We divide the protection mechanisms between online and offline use cases, and organise them into six categories depending on the nature of their algorithm. Moreover, this article surveys the evaluation metrics used to assess protection mechanisms in terms of privacy, utility and performance. Finally, open challenges and new directions to address the problem of computational location privacy are pointed out and discussed.},

This book also presents an overview on both fundamentals and the state-of-the-art research inspired by spatial trajectory data, as well as a special focus on trajectory pattern mining, spatio-temporal data mining and location-based social networks. Each chapter provides readers with a tutorial-style introduction to one important aspect of location trajectory computing, case studies and many valuable references to other relevant research work. Computing with Spatial Trajectories is designed as a reference or secondary text book for advanced-level students and researchers mainly focused on computer science and geography. Professionals working on spatial trajectory computing will also find this book very useful.},

	abstract = {The problem of unicity and reidentifiability of records in large-scale databases has been studied in different contexts and approaches, with focus on preserving privacy or matching records from different data sources. With an increasing number of service providers nowadays routinely collecting location traces of their users on unprecedented scales, there is a pronounced interest in the possibility of matching records and datasets based on spatial trajectories. Extending previous work on reidentifiability of spatial data and trajectory matching, we present the first large-scale analysis of user matchability in real mobility datasets on realistic scales, i.e. among two datasets that consist of several million people's mobility traces, coming from a mobile network operator and transportation smart card usage. We extract the relevant statistical properties which influence the matching process and analyze their impact on the matchability of users. We show that for individuals with typical activity in the transportation system (those making 3-4 trips per day on average), a matching algorithm based on the co-occurrence of their activities is expected to achieve a 16.8\% success only after a one-week long observation of their mobility traces, and over 55\% after four weeks. We show that the main determinant of matchability is the expected number of co-occurring records in the two datasets. Finally, we discuss different scenarios in terms of data collection frequency and give estimates of matchability over time. We show that with higher frequency data collection becoming more common, we can expect much higher success rates in even shorter intervals.},

In a nutshell, we extend a mobility model called Mobility Markov Chain (MMC) in order to incorporate the n previous visited locations and we develop a novel algorithm for next location prediction based on this mobility model that we coined as n-MMC. The evaluation of the efﬁciency of our algorithm on three different datasets demonstrates an accuracy for the prediction of the next location in the range of 70\% to 95\% as soon as n = 2.},

The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to kanonymity unless accompanying policies are respected.

In a {\textbackslash}kappa-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least k—1 other records with respect to certain "identifying" attributes. In this paper we show with two simple attacks that a {\textbackslash}kappa-anonymized dataset has some subtle, but severe privacy problems. First, we show that an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that {\textbackslash}kappa-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks and we propose a novel and powerful privacy definition called {\textbackslash}ell-diversity. In addition to building a formal foundation for {\textbackslash}ell-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that {\textbackslash}ell-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.},

Such datasets are becoming accessible to an increasingly broad community of researchers and data scientists, with a variety of analytical and policy uses proposed. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art in this area of research, then sets out a new analytical framework for such data sources that focuses on three pressing issues: first, interpretation and disciplinary bias; second, the potential risks to data subjects in low- and middle-income countries and possible ethical responses; and third, the likelihood of ‘function creep’ from benign to less benign uses. Using the case study of a data science challenge involving West African mobile phone data, I argue that human mobility is becoming legible in new, more detailed ways, and that this carries with it the dual risk of rendering certain groups invisible and of misinterpreting what is visible. Thus, this emerging ability to track movement in real time offers both the possibility of improved responses to conflict and forced migration, but also unprecedented power to surveil and control unwanted population movement.},

However, unrestricted access to such data may reveal sensible locations and pose safety risks if the data is associated to a specific moving individual. This is one of the many reasons to consider trajectory anonymization.Some anonymization methods rely on grouping individual registers on a database and publishing summaries in such a way that individual information is protected inside the group. Other approaches consist of adding noise, such as differential privacy, in a way that the presence of an individual cannot be inferred from the data.In this paper, we present a perturbative anonymization method based on swapping segments for trajectory data (SwapMob). It preserves the aggregate information of the spatial database and at the same time, provides anonymity to the individuals.We have performed tests on a set of GPS trajectories of 10,357 taxis during the period of Feb. 2 to Feb. 8, 2008, within Beijing. We show that home addresses and POIs of specific individuals cannot be inferred after anonymizing them with SwapMob, and remark that the aggregate mobility data is preserved without changes, such as the average length of trajectories or the number of cars and their directions on any given zone at a specific time.},

We propose a novel concept of k-anonymity based on co-localization that exploits the inherent uncertainty of the moving object’s whereabouts. Due to sampling and positioning systems (e.g., GPS) imprecision, the trajectory of a moving object is no longer a polyline in a three-dimensional space, instead it is a cylindrical volume, where its radius δ represents the possible location imprecision: we know that the trajectory of the moving object is within this cylinder, but we do not know exactly where. If another object moves within the same cylinder they are indistinguishable from each other. This leads to the deﬁnition of (k, δ)-anonymity for moving objects databases.},

In this paper we study geo-indistinguishability, a formal notion of privacy for location-based systems that protects the exact location of a user, while still allowing approximate information - typically needed to obtain a certain desired service - to be released. Our privacy definition formalizes the intuitive notion of protecting the user's location within a radius r with a level of privacy that depends on r. We present three equivalent characterizations of this notion, one of which corresponds to a generalized version of the well-known concept of differential privacy. Furthermore, we present a perturbation technique for achieving geo-indistinguishability by adding controlled random noise to the user's location, drawn from a planar Laplace distribution. We demonstrate the applicability of our technique through two case studies: First, we show how to enhance applications for location-based services with privacy guarantees by implementing our technique on the client side of the application. Second, we show how to apply our technique to sanitize location-based sensible information collected by the US Census Bureau.},

	abstract = {The pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies has made it possible to collect the movement data of individuals or vehicles. However, it has to be carefully managed to ensure that there is no privacy breach. In this paper, we investigate the problem of publishing trajectory data under the differential privacy model. A straightforward solution is to add noise to a trajectory - this can be done either by adding noise to each coordinate of the position, to each position of the trajectory, or to the whole trajectory. However, such naive approaches result in trajectories with zigzag shapes and many crossings, making the published trajectories of little practical use. We introduce a mechanism called SDD (Sampling Distance and Direction), which is ε-differentially private. SDD samples a suitable direction and distance at each position to publish the next possible position. Numerical experiments conducted on real ship trajectories demonstrate that our proposed mechanism can deliver ship trajectories that are of good practical utility.},

	abstract = {Abstract—Nowadays companies increasingly aggregate loca-tion data from different sources on the Internet to offer location-based services such as estimating current road traffic conditions, and finding the best nightlife locations in a city. However, these services have also caused outcries over privacy issues. As the volume of location data being aggregated expands, the comfort of sharing one’s whereabouts with the public at large will unavoidably decrease. Existing ways of aggregating location data in the privacy literature are largely centralized in that they rely on a trusted location-based service. Instead, we propose a piece of software (SpotME) that can run on a mobile phone and is able to estimate the number of people in geographic locations in a privacy-preserving way: accurate estimations are made possible in the presence of privacy-conscious users who report, in addition to their actual locations, a very large number of erroneous locations. The erroneous locations are selected by a randomized response algorithm. We evaluate the accuracy of SpotME in estimating the number of people upon two very different realistic mobility traces: the mobility of vehicles in urban, suburban and rural areas, and the mobility of subway train passengers in Greater London. We find that erroneous locations have little effect on the estimations (in both traces, the error is below 18 \% for a situation in which more than 99\% of the locations are erroneous), yet they guarantee that users cannot be localized with high probability. Also, the computational and storage overheads for a mobile phone running SpotME are negligible, and the communication overhead is limited. I.},

In this paper, we assume that the majority of the information that exists in the mobility dataset must remain private and the data has to stay in-house to the hosting organization. To facilitate privacyaware sharing of the mobility data we develop a trajectory query engine that allows subscribed users to gain restricted access to the database to accomplish various analysis tasks. The proposed engine (i) audits queries for trajectory data to block potential attacks to user privacy, (ii) supports range, distance, and k-nearest neighbors spatial and spatiotemporal queries, and (iii) preserves user anonymity in answers to queries by (a) augmenting the real trajectories with a set of carefully crafted, realistic fake trajectories, and (b) ensuring that no user-speciﬁc sensitive locations are reported as part of the returned trajectories.},

	abstract = {Recently, highly accurate positioning devices enable us to provide various types of location-based services. On the other hand, because position data obtained by such devices include deeply personal information, protection of location privacy is one of the most significant issues of location-based services. Therefore, we propose a technique to anonymize position data. In our proposed technique, the psrsonal user of a location-based service generates several false position data (dummies) sent to the service provider with the true position data of the user. Because the service provider cannot distinguish the true position data, the user’s location privacy is protected. We conducted performance study experiments on our proposed technique using practical trajectory data. As a result of the experiments, we observed that our proposed technique protects the location privacy of users.},

	abstract = {GPS devices allow recording the movement track of the moving object they are attached to. This data typically consists of a stream of spatio-temporal (x,y,t) points. For application purposes the stream is transformed into finite subsequences called \{{\textbackslash}em trajectories\}. Existing knowledge extraction algorithms defined for trajectories mainly assume a specific context (e.g. vehicle movements) or analyze specific parts of a trajectory (e.g. stops), in association with data from chosen geographic sources (e.g. points-of-interest, road networks). We investigate a more comprehensive semantic annotation framework that allows enriching trajectories with any kind of semantic data provided by multiple 3rd party sources. This paper presents SeMiTri - the framework that enables annotating \%all meaningful parts of trajectories for any kind of moving objects. Doing so, the application can benefit from a \{{\textbackslash}it {\textbackslash}lq{\textbackslash}lq semantic trajectory{\textbackslash}rq{\textbackslash}rq\} representation of the physical movement. The framework and its algorithms have been designed to work on trajectories with varying data quality and different structures, with the objective of covering abstraction requirements of a wide range of applications. Performance of SeMiTri has been evaluated using many GPS datasets from multiple sources -- including both fast moving objects (e.g. cars, trucks) and people's trajectories (e.g. with smartphones). These two kinds of experiments are reported in this paper. Yan, Zhixian; Chakraborty, Dipanjan; Parent, Christine; Spaccapietra, Stefano; Aberer, Karl},

Such data provide opportunistic sensing and the means for transit operators to match supply with mobility demand inferred from mobile phone locations. In contrast to previous methods of transit network design, the proposed method is entirely data driven, leveraging the large-sample properties of disaggregate mobile phone network data and mobility pattern mining. The method works by deriving frequent patterns of movements from anonymized mobile phone location data and merging them to generate candidate route designs. Additional routines for optimal route selection and service frequency setting are then employed to select a network configuration made up of routes that maximizes systemwide traveler utility. Using data from half a million mobile phone users in Abidjan from the telco operator Orange, we demonstrated to provide resource-neutral system improvement of 27\% in terms of end-user journey times.},
